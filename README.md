Module 8 Journal

This project is a game where an agent(pirate) aims to get to the treasure before the human. This is achieved through the use of deep Q-learning neural networks and reinforcement learning. Almost all of the code was initialy provided and I had to insert the code for the Q-learning portion which also provided a pseudocode outline. The file attached has all of the code used.

What do computer scientists do and why does it matter?

Computer scientist have a series of applications ranging from hardware to software. Computer scientist work on databases, front-end and back-end applications and everything in between.

How do I approach a problem as a computer scientist?

My approach is to be observant and to take notes. I often have to make changes to achieve my goal, and if the change alters my project I need to be able to backtrack to when it worked. I also try to keep an open mind to more efficent methods as I can always immprove.

What are my ethical responsibilities to the end user and the organization?

My ethical responsibilities consist of ensuring that databases are free of internal bias, hidden or not, and to negate it by referencing multiple people for review. The best way to identify bias is to include others of different sexes, races, and religious beliefs.
